# Movies of the 90s
My Capstone for Nashville Software School
## Executive Summary
The 90's produced some amazing movies that people still watch and reference today. Most times when we go to the movies Rotten Tomato's critic ratings are taken into account. Some movies audiences pass on just based on the low critic ratings. With this data, I hope to show the highest grossing movies in the 90â€™s and how they compare to professional critic ratings. I also want to show a visualization of if there was a more popular genre and film rating

## Motivation
Movies have always been a passion of mine. The 90's was a great time for films and I thought it would be fun to dig deeper into the movies I love so much.

## Data Question
Titanic was the highest grossing film in the 90's. What makes a high grossing film? Do the Rotten Tomato Scores have anything to do with how well a film does in the Box Office? Are there any correlating factors that can guarantee a film will do well?
