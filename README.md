# Movies of the 90s
My Capstone for Nashville Software School

## Executive Summary
The 90's produced some amazing films that people still watch and reference today. Most times when we go to the movies, Rotten Tomato's critic ratings are taken into account. Some audiences pass on just based on the low critic ratings. With this data, I hope to show the highest grossing films in the 90’s and how they compare to professional critic ratings. I wanted to take a closer look at what made a successful film in the 90's.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was my passion for films, especially those made in the 90’s. The progression of technology is extremely evident through this period of time and stories that weren’t possible before are now not only passible but the computer-generated imagery is more believable than ever.

Whenever I want to go see a film, someone I know wants to look at the Rotten Tomato score for that film and sometimes it deters us from going. I made me question if the Rotten Tomato scores really do have any impact on how successful a film is in the box office. It made me question what makes a successful film in the 90's?

## Data Question
